# PanguGo

This is a gadget that converts text and files to paranoid using Pangu.

Paranoid text spacing for good readability, to automatically insert whitespace between CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean), half-width English, digit and symbol characters.

For more details about Pangu, visit [pangu.cs](https://github.com/Roger-WIN/pangu.cs).

For files conversion, you can select multiple files, or you can select one folder. But they cannot be selected at the same time.
